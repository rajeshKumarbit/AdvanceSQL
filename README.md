## This is all about SQL from basic to advance

- SQL is a must know skill when it comes to data retrieval and manipulation.

- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is used to insert, update, and query data in a database.

- SQL commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, among others. It is widely used in businesses and organizations of all sizes, and is the standard language for relational database management systems such as MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

- SQL works by allowing users to interact with a database through a series of commands. These commands are used to insert, update, and retrieve data from the database. The basic structure of an SQL statement includes a command, followed by the name of the table or tables being affected, and any conditions or constraints that need to be met.
When an SQL statement is executed, the database management system (DBMS) parses the statement and translates it into a series of instructions that the database can understand. The DBMS then communicates with the database and retrieves or modifies the data as specified by the SQL statement.
For example, a SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database table. The statement specifies the columns and rows that should be retrieved, as well as any conditions that need to be met. The DBMS then retrieves the requested data and returns it to the user in a structured format.
SQL is declarative, meaning that you specify what you want the outcome to be, but not how the DBMS should get there. The SQL engine optimizes the query and execute the most efficient plan to obtain the desired result.

- In summary, SQL allows users to interact with relational databases by sending commands to the DBMS, which in turn communicates with the database to retrieve or modify data based on the SQL statement.
